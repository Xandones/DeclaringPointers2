This file is a basic example of using pointers.


Pointers stores RAM memory adresses for varibles. They may be used to make operations indirectly with the variables.
I made a mistake with the previous file (I overwritten it with GitHUb) but everything that was inside the previous project is included in this one.
It shows how we declare pointers, how we set values for varibles where the pointers points, how we set values using a secondary pointer,
it also shows how we alter a value of a varible using pointers.
